KelNotes on Git Branching and Merging  *NOTE* - wrap your text

Init a new project creates a single branch called master.  The 'origin' is a variable that gets assigned the value of the URL where the repository resides on the web.  This needs to only be done once.

Your new project now has a single 'default branch' titled "master".  Although it is the one created with your new repo, it can be thought of like just another branch once you start creating multiple branches, with one distinguishing feature being it is the MASTER branch into which all other branches get merged into.

**NOTE**  When merging a branch with another, be SURE you are residing inside the one your merging into as the command:
	"git merge <branchName>"
will merge the 2nd branch titled <branchName> INTO the branch you currently reside.  It is also possible to merge two of your own branches together by simply doing the following: - for example: "kel1" and "kel2" 

	git checkout -b kel1	
	git merge kel2		
	git branch -d kel2	

  ** creates and moves into the new branch 'kel1'
  ** merges kel2 with the current branch your in (right now, kel1)
  ** since all changes merged into kel2, don't need kel1 any more so 'safe' delete

git branch -D kel2 would FORCE delete (uppercase -D) even if there are uncommited but BEWARE!

Multiple branch mergin conflicts:
 - HEAD is the incoming change, separated using:
<<<<<<<<<<<< HEAD, and =============
