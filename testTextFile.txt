New text file to commit to new git repository
Ok, got the hang of this I think - making change to testTextFile (this) in my Kelbranch
Deleted previous 'Kel' branch using uppercase -D tag
created mew 'Kel' branch with existing master branch and updated this 'textTextFile'
created branch using "-b tag to create and checkout at the same time
  will make Kel3 after making this commit
  used this url to figure out setting the upstream branch: git push --set-upstream origin kel2
    https://devconnected.com/how-to-set-upstream-branch-on-git/

    Line 10 (AFTER merge) This is the new kel2 branch final change before comparing with pull request)
    Line 11 (before second merge, after conflict of removing text on line 10 was pushed)

    Line 13 created in kel3 branch which I will now save, add, commit, and merge with master
