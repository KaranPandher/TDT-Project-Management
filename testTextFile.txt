New text file to commit to new git repository
Ok, got the hang of this I think - making change to testTextFile (this) in my Kelbranch
Deleted previous 'Kel' branch using uppercase -D tag
created mew 'Kel' branch with existing master branch and updated this 'textTextFile'





checkout kel (one) and made this change before merging both kel and kel1 in just a few moments
more changes...........
