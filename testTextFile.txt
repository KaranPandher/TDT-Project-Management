New text file to commit to new git repository
Ok, got the hang of this I think - making change to testTextFile (this) in my Kelbranch
Deleted previous 'Kel' branch using uppercase -D tag
created mew 'Kel' branch with existing master branch and updated this 'textTextFile'
created branch using "-b tag to create and checkout at the same time
  will make Kel3 after making this commit
  used this url to figure out setting the upstream branch: git push --set-upstream origin kel2
