New text file to commit to new git repository
Ok, got the hang of this I think - making change to testTextFile (this) in my Kelbranch
Deleted previous 'Kel' branch using uppercase -D tag
created mew 'Kel' branch with existing master branch and updated this 'textTextFile'






checkout kel (one) and made this change before merging both kel and kel1 in just a few moments
set upstream branch url with: git push --set-upstream origin kel
This is the first branch created by kel and the last one commited by kel before comparing branches 1 and 2 to the master branch
After a successful push, I will delete kel2 using lowercase -d tag, finally I will merge the kel branch and keep it there for later uppercase
FINAL ADDITION BY KEL BEFORE MERGING ALL KEL BRANCHES FROM TODAYS WORK
** Last step was to set up tracking of remote branch using command: "git push --set-upstream origin Kel"
created branch using "-b tag to create and checkout at the same time
  will make Kel3 after making this commit
  used this url to figure out setting the upstream branch: git push --set-upstream origin kel2

    Line 10 (AFTER merge) This is the new kel2 branch final change before comparing with pull request)
    Line 11 (before second merge, after conflict of removing text on line 10 was pushed)

    Will save, add, commit and push upstream to create a node on the branch,
