New text file to commit to new git repository
Ok, got the hang of this I think - making change to testTextFile (this) in my Kelbranch
Deleted previous 'Kel' branch using uppercase -D tag
created mew 'Kel' branch with existing master branch and updated this 'textTextFile'





checkout kel (one) and made this change before merging both kel and kel1 in just a few moments
set upstream branch url with: git push --set-upstream origin kel

This is the first branch created by kel and the last one commited by kel before comparing branches 1 and 2 to the master branch
After a successful push, I will delete kel2 using lowercase -d tag, finally I will merge the kel branch and keep it there for later uppercase
